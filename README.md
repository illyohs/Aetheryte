## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn build` or `yarn dist`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  The bundle is then wrapped up in
electron.

### `yarn electron`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
